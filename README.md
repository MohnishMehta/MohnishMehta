# Hi I'm Mohnish 👋
 🎓 Junior at Rutgers University, studying Computer Science & Data Science
 
 I'm a motivated student at Rutgers University’s School of Arts and Sciences, double-majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. Known for my strong work ethic and curiosity, I’m eager to turn classroom lessons into real-world tech solutions while continually sharpening my coding and analytical skills. I enjoy collaborating on projects that make a measurable impact and look forward to new opportunities to learn and contribute.

🎯 Featured Project: Predictive Maintenance for Pump Failure (Accenture Early Careers Program)

What We Did:
Engineered a full machine learning workflow to predict pump failures using time-series sensor data from an oil & chemicals client. Cleaned and transformed raw telemetry, built lag-based and rolling-window features, and applied domain-driven preprocessing to capture early signs of degradation.

Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Result:
Achieved strong failure-prediction performance using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models (with engineered time-series features improving accuracy significantly). The model identifies patterns leading up to mechanical faults, enabling earlier maintenance scheduling and reducing unplanned downtime.

🛠 Tech Stack

Languages: Python, Java, C++
Data Science & ML: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Time-Series & Modeling: Feature engineering (lags, rolling stats), Logistic Regression, Random Forest
Web & Scripting: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic)
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub

🚀 Projects

A few other noteworthy projects I’ve worked on:

Airbnb Superhost Prediction Model 

Built a machine learning model to predict whether a host would earn Superhost status using the NYC Airbnb dataset. Conducted exploratory data analysis, cleaned and standardized host/listing features, and trained multiple models using GridSearchCV to identify the best-performing classifier.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Learnings: Feature engineering, model evaluation (ROC/AUC), hyperparameter tuning, and interpreting real-world hospitality data.

GLATOS Marine Field Station: Fish Telemetry Analysis 

Analyzed acoustic telemetry data collected at the Rutgers Marine Field Station using R and the GLATOS package. Processed fish movement detections, visualized migration patterns, and identified spatial/temporal behavior trends across receivers in the Great Bay region.
Tech Stack: R, GLATOS, tidyverse, ggplot2
Learnings: Data wrangling in R, ecological data analysis, spatial visualization, and understanding animal movement through acoustic telemetry systems.
